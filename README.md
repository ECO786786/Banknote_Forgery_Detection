# Detecting Forged Banknotes: A K-Means Clustering Solution

## Background

The bank is facing challenges in accurately detecting forged banknotes, which can lead to significant financial losses and a decline in customer trust. To improve the detection process, the bank is considering the use of the K-Means clustering algorithm, focusing specifically on two key features: the variance of Wavelet transformed images (V1) and the skewness of Wavelet transformed images (V2). This project aims to utilise these continuous features to automate the identification of potential forged banknotes through clustering analysis.

## Objectives:

- Data Collection: Gather a dataset of banknotes, including their V1 (variance) and V2 (skewness) values, along with labels for genuine and forged notes.

- Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy in clustering.

- K-Means Clustering: Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm using V1 and V2 to group the banknotes, identifying clusters that potentially represent forged notes.

- Cluster Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of the resulting clusters to differentiate between genuine and forged banknotes based on their V1 and V2 values.

- Integration Recommendations: Propose a strategy for incorporating the K-Means clustering approach into the bank's existing forgery detection processes.

- Expected Outcomes:
  A detailed clustering analysis that identifies patterns in V1 and V2, helping to differentiate between genuine and forged banknotes.

- Recommendations for feature selection and data handling to optimise clustering results.
  A practical implementation plan for integrating K-Means clustering into the bank's operations, improving the efficiency and accuracy of forgery detection.
